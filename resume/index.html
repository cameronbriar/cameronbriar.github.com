He has no problem thinking big picture while maintaining focus on the problem at hand. Despite having his responsibilities multiplied, he&rsquo;s still responsive to requests for recommendations or assistance. He&rsquo;s also saved my ass on at least a couple of occasions and has likely done the same for others around here. I think Cameron is a developer worthy of others emulating and should continue to be recognized for his outstanding work.</div><p><small>Chief Architect, FocusVision, 2016</small></p>
