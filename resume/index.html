He has no problem thinking big picture while maintaining focus on the problem at hand. Despite having his responsibilities multiplied, he&#39;s still responsive to requests for recommendations or assistance. He&#39;s also saved my ass on at least a couple of occasions and has likely done the same for others around here. I think Cameron is a developer worthy of others emulating and should continue to be recognized for his outstanding work.</div>

Our early trials demonstrate that Flynt is significantly easier, quicker, and more efficient than traditional approaches.
